<h2 style="text-align: center;"><em><strong>The Problem:</strong></em></h2>
<p style="text-align: left;">Staying adequately hydrated is a major healthcare concern for patients and family members. One limiting factor is the ability of people with medical conditions to safely hold drinks without spilling. These conditions include neuromuscular conditions such as Parkinson&rsquo;s Disease, Muscular Dystrophy, Multiple Sclerosis, Cerebral Palsy, ALS, etc., stroke, traumatic brain injuries, paralysis, spinal cord injuries, amputations, dementia, birth defects, visual impairments, burns, and upper extremity injuries.</p>
<details><summary>More on the Problem</summary>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>These same conditions make it difficult to hold and use electronic devices such as cellphones, computer tablets and books.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Without the ACG Hands-Free Support System someone in a healthcare facility or at home has to either hold the drinks and other items or clean up the spills that can cause scalding injuries. After a spill it takes time and expense and to change clothing, bedding and clean floors. It also keeps nurses and aides away for other patient&rsquo;s needs that can precent falls.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><em>Connecting the Dots: How a Hands-Free Support System can Reduce Liability By Preventing Falls and Avoiding Missed Warning Signs for Other Patients</em></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: center;" align="center"><strong><em>By Steven White, J.D. and Wanda Neal, R.N.</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>ABSTRACT:</strong></p>
<p>Fall injuries in healthcare facilities and senior living communities are a major source of patient/resident disability, leading to fractures and other co-morbidities up to and including death. Delayed call light response times by nursing staff and failure to complete hourly nursing rounds have both been specifically correlated with preventable falls. Staffing shortages leading to increased nurse-patient ratios and budget cuts are increasingly important factors. Another significant factor, as suggested in this article, is the time-consuming needs of patients who are unable to hold drinks or eat independently. Spills can require clothing and bedding changes, floor cleanups and additional care. A low-cost hands-free support system to &ldquo;take the hands out of the equation&rdquo; for disabled patients and residents helps to provide much needed hydration. It has the added benefit of keeping them entertained and occupied by safely holding electronic devices can significantly reduce these events as well as improve their overall health and quality of life. Additionally, simple but incredibly useful tools such as these can lead to a reduction in medical malpractice claims, negligence and hospital acquired conditions when preventable falls can occur in multiple areas of the healthcare system. Further research is suggested.</p>
